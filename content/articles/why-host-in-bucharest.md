Bucharest has grown into a credible regional hub for Eastern Europe. You get proximity to Central and Southeast Europe, mature datacenters, and plenty of budget KVM options. For workloads targeting Romania or nearby countries, latency and throughput are typically strong. As always, match the plan to the job: storage-heavy projects benefit from NVMe, while bandwidth-heavy services should check real port speeds and fair use policies. Keep an eye on IPv6 and DDoS options to avoid surprises later.
